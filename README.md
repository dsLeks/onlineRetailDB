#Project Title: Online Retail Database 

In this project I designed a Database using DrawIO and I created an Entity Relationship Diagram. Using MySQL workbench I forward engineered this ERD to an EER. 
My EER file is named: `OnlineRetailDB-Final.sql` 

I created inserts to test certain triggers, functions, and procedures. I use this database to create a discord bot that will query this database based on the
command that the user inputs to the bot.
